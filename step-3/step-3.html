      <h2>Crazy 8's</h2>

      <p>When trying to create a solution to an issue, It is rarely ever the first one that is the best one. I’m sure many of you have heard of crazy 8’s but this isn’t the card game.
        The goal of the crazy 8’s ideation method is to create many ideas in order to generate a solid solution to your issue.</p>

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <div class="method-step-1">
        <h2>Step 1.</h2>
        <p>Have a goal. First and foremost, whether you are doing this as a team or individually you nee dto have a clear assessment on the problem. The core of the problem, the scope, and any other restraints need to be equally understood by all</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-2">
        <h2>Step 2.</h2>
        <p>The setup. This method can be done either online with sketching software or with pen and paper. All you need is 8 separate sections to create sketch's on. For the purposes of explanation I will assume we are using pen and paper.
           So, take the paper (A4 size works best) and divide it into 8 equal parts by either folding or drawing line.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-3">
        <h2>Step 3.</h2>
        <p>Time to sketch! Set up a timer for 8 minutes, one that beeps every minute. The goal here is to sketch 8 different ideas that solve the problem in 8 minutes. It is crucial to complete all 8 sketches as the last idea tends to be the most creative.
           So, every time the timer beeps, whether the last sketch has been fully finished or not, you should be moving on to the next idea. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-4">
        <h2>Step 4.</h2>
        <p>Presentation. This step is more specifically for a team environment. So, since the sketches will be very rough and somewhat unfinished it is best to allow some time for each person to explain the concept behind the sketch briefly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-5">
        <h2>Step 5.</h2>
        <p>Evaluation. Now that the exercise is done it is time to figure which ideas are worthwhile to pursue. If you are in a team you can each be given a number of votes (maybe 3) and and vote on the ideas you think are best.
          Whichever few have the most votes are likely the best ones to pursue and potentially prototype!</p>
