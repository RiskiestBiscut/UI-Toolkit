      <h2>Interview</h2>
      <img src="../images/Microphone.svg" alt="interview graphic">
      <p>In terms of understanding and empathizing with those you are designing for, there is no better wat than having a conversation with them. An interview.</p>

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <div class="method-step-1">
        <h2>Step 1.</h2>
        <p>Start by planning a date with the interviewee that works for yourself and them. Be sure not to have more than two or three team members attend, as anymore could overwhelm the participant.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-2">
        <h2>Step 2.</h2>
        <p>Devise a set of questions you would like to ask. Start with broad questions that are more about personality, likes, and dislikes to ease the participant into the more specific
           questions that pertain the issue you are investigating. A good rule of thumb is about 10 solid questions for a standard length interview (1-2 hours).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-3">
        <h2>Step 3.</h2>
        <p>During the actual interview it might be best to delegate certain tasks to different people. Have one person focus on the conversation and another one or two recording information.
          This was you can ensure that improvisational questions can be asked and all information can be recorded accurately. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-4">
        <h2>Step 4.</h2>
        <p>. Recording information is ultimately the most important aspect of an interview. Whether you can voice record of physically write down what the participants answers are you must
          ensure that quotes are 100% accurate and you are not writing down interpretations. Make note of body language as well as it can add to context of quotes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-5">
        <h2>Step 5.</h2>
        <p>Transcribe and analyze. Once the interview is over ensure that there is an accurate transcription of the interview and begin to asses what information is relevant,
          any patterns you can find, and any strong attention grabbing quotes.</p>
