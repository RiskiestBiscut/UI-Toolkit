      <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
      <img src="../images/empathy map.svg" alt="empathy map graphic">
      <p>When trying to fully understand the  issue at hand and defining who the stakeholders are an empathy map becomes very useful. Specifically, when not all members of
        your team have been able to interact with all users. It accumulates observations and data to define who the main stakeholder is.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="method-steps-container">
      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <div class="method-step-1">
        <h2>Step 1.</h2>
        <p>Research, duh. In order for empathy mapping to work each team member should come prepared with data, and observations that are reliable and defensible.
          Without accurate data there really is no point in attempting to make an empathy map. If possible try to have potential users present to assist with the map creation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-2">
        <h2>Step 2.</h2>
        <p>Set up the map. An Empathy is a four quadrant grid with the stakeholder planted in the center via a sketch; usually on a white board or somewhere impermanent.
          Each quadrant should be labeled using the terms Says, does, Thinks, and Feels. The stakeholder should have a name and brief description of who they might be (be creative here as this isnâ€™t yet a real person but stay accurate).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-3">
        <h2>Step 3.</h2>
        <p>start mapping. Using the data already gathered and discussion during the empathy map session start plotting observations in whichever quadrant is most appropriate. Keep each idea separate, using sticky notes is a great way to do this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-4">
        <h2>Step 4.</h2>
        <p>Analyze. Within each section of the map look for similar ideas and piece together a big picture . try and understand the different aspects of this stakeholders life and imagine yourself in their shoes; empathize with them ( hence the term empathy map, wow what a concept ðŸ˜Š).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-5">
        <h2>Step 5.</h2>
        <p>Validate. Look for anything that seems interesting or important. What doers everyone agree on or think is relevant? What could be missing? Also be sure to find any possible assumptions that may have to be confirmed. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-6">
        <h2>Step 6.</h2>
        <p>Repeat steps 3-5. An empathy map is never truly complete and is a tool that should be used throughout the duration of the design process to check in with and confirm or reevaluate ideas.</p>
