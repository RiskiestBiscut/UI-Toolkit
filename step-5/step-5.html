      <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
      <img src="../images/AB test.svg" alt="interview graphic">
      <p>A/B testing is a form of testing a design quantitatively that involves two versions of one product or piece of content. The best function of it is typically when implementing a potential new feature into a product.
         It starts with an idea for a change in a product or prototype and tests it with a control to see if that change is worthwhile.</p>

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <div class="method-step-1">
        <h2>Step 1.</h2>
        <p>Pick a variable. There may be many aspects or changes that need to be tested but for A/B testing to properly work only one thing can be tested at a time. This will be what is known as an ‘independent’ variable, it is the thing that is being tested.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-2">
        <h2>Step 2.</h2>
        <p>Determine what you are measuring. If you are familiar with any form of empirical testing you likely know where this is going. In the first step we picked an independent variable and we now need to pick a dependent variable, this is what will be measured.
          While many things might be measured during an A/B test the dependent variable is most important as it will provide a basis for analysis at the end of the test. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-3">
        <h2>Step 3.</h2>
        <p>Hypothesis. Now that you have your dependent and independent variables you will want to create a hypothesis. This is a prediction of how the dependent variable will change based on what changes are made to the independent variable. i.e. ‘the sign up button will get more clicks if we move it from spot A to spot B.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-4">
        <h2>Step 4.</h2>
        <p>create you’re a and B. this is where you develop your two states of the independent variable, a control, typically the current unaltered version of the product, and a challenger, the new variation you want to implement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-5">
        <h2>Step 5.</h2>
        <p>Split you testing groups. For A/B testing to work well you will need a group to test both the control and the challenger variations. Each group should be equal and randomly selected to get the best results.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-6">
        <h2>Step 6.</h2>
        <p>Determine significance. Before beginning the actual testing phase you should decide what the results need to look like for it to be significant enough to implement the changes. If the control and challenger results are within a few percent it may just be random coincidence rather than an significant result..</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-7">
        <h2>Step 7.</h2>
        <p>Time to Test! The set up is done and it is time to role out the test. In order for this to be successful both version A and B need to be tested at the same time and be tested long enough to ensure useful data. It is crucially important to keep each test as similar as possible aleit for the change of the independent variable. If the tests are too different, say version A is tested in March and B tested in April, you can’t be sure that the results were different due to a change in time or a change in independent variable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="method-step-8">
        <h2>Step 8.</h2>
        <p>Analyze and implement. When the test comes to an end it is time to determine the significance of the results. Look for statistics, ratios and other information to indicate whether your hypothesis was true or not.
          If you got the results you we relooking for you can finalize the change you wanted to mak; if not it is time for a new idea and a new session of A/B testing.</p>
